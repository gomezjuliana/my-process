I started with FreeCodeCamp and I did:
- HTML5 and CSS
- Responsive Design with Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Basic FE Prjects:
	- Create a Tribute Page (link)
	- Build a Portfolio Page (link) - this was later edited
- Basic JavaScript
- Object Oriented and Functional Programming
- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- JSON APIs and Ajax
- Intermediate FE Development Projects:
	- Build a random quote machine
	- Show the local weather
	- Build a Wikipedia Viewer

After I finished these last three, my mentor taught me how to use git and GitHub to start versioning my projects and use repositories to showcase my code. From here I started reading Eloquent Javascript (link) and it was cool but it was also really hard. Knowing JavaScript better now, I recommend diving in after you've done a couple projects and are familiar with objects and arrays and looking up documentation.

The following are projects (you might notice that most of them are coding challenges for job applications) that I did and then got code reviews on:
	- photo gallery (Prodigous)
	- WireDelta
	- moving divs
	- graybit
	- navexercise
	- conquer
	- sight
	- submit form
	- gist finder
